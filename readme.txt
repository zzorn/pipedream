== Architecture ==

World consists of spaces, that contain entities, and that can be connected to other spaces.
A server can control one or more spaces and the entities in them.
Servers can hand over spaces to other servers depending on loads.
Entities can have internal spaces (e.g. house, vehicle entity).
Entities can be passive or have actuators and sensors for interacting with the world.
For non-simple mapping of perceptions and internal state to actions, entities can have AI:s.
AI:s can be run on different servers than the entities they control.
Entities can have ports, that can be connected to adjacent entities, for transfer of matter, energy, or information.
